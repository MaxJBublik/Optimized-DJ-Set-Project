    "#### These days, everyone can DJ. The hobby has exploded in popularity as more people realize the fun and relative ease one can have ordering their favorite songs into a consistent stream of music, even utilizing available filters, transition effects or additional music hardware to personalize the set to their interests.\n",

    "#### This file utilizes a min-cost Network flow optimization model to determine the optimal ordering of a Spotify playlist with respect to various parameters given by the Spotify API. I have provided the base code to allow the creation of your own CSV file to optimize over any playlist desired, however I will be providing a CSV file named songdata.csv in order to display the process of my model."

    "I am collecting my data through a utilization of the Spotify API that allows me to gather data on individual track's from a spotify playlist. This allows me to use any playlist on spotify to order the songs, optimizing for different features available through the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the API requires a unique personal Client ID and Client Secret, I elected to save my data in a .csv file that my model will run over. However, code blocks on the bottom of this notebook will instruct you how to add your own spotify playlists to my optimization model\n",

    "Certain features can be ignored from the response, such as the song ID (which is used to check if the song is the same when organizing data), uri, analysis_url id and track_href.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before inserting our data into our optimization model, we must remove any possible infiltration of the playlist by media not appropriate for a live DJ set. The two features to account for are Liveness and Speechiness. Any liveness value above 0.8 is most likely to be a live recording of the song, which would not be ideal to perform with. Any speechiness value above 0.66 is likely media that is entirely composed of speech, like a podcast or radio show, which would sound quite weird to play. We also remove any songs that would tamper witht the model, like missing key values represented by values of -1. \n",

    "The remaining features to consider are the following: \n",

    ">Danceability - value between 0 and 1 that marks how danceable a song is\n",
    "\n",
    ">energy - value between 0 and 1 that marks how intense a song is, marked by being fast, loud and noisy\n",
    "\n",
    ">key - integer representation of the musical key the song is in (more info below)\n",
    "\n",
    ">loudness - the average decibles of a track, ranging from -60 to 0\n",
    "\n",
    ">mode - indicates if the song is major (1) or minor (0) key\n",
    "\n",
    ">speechiness - as mentioned, value from 0 to 1 indicating how much speech is present in a track\n",
    "\n",
    ">acousticness - measure between 0 and 1 indicating how likely it is the track was recorded from acoustic source\n",
    "\n",
    ">instrumentalness - measure between 0 and 1 indicating how likely a track contains no vocals. \n",
    "\n",
    ">valence - measure between 0 and 1 indicating the musical positiveness, values closer to 1 are more happy and upbeat while 0 are sad or depressing\n",
    "\n",
    ">durration_ms - how many miliseconds long a song is\n",
    "\n",
    ">time_signature - indicates the time signature as an integer divided by 4, so a value of 4 is in 4/4 time, 3 is in 3/4 time, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "let's optimize over these values. "
